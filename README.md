written on this language describe Wavecat computing modules. Every module is an
independent part of the Wavecat system computing one Special Function of Wave
Catastrophes (SWC).

WLC can be built-in to Wavecat or compiled to a Wavecat plugin.

Building of WLC is simple as typing 'make' in the shell.
